% Define the move predicate for Towers of Hanoi
hanoi(N) :-
    move(N, left, center, right).

% Base case: Moving 0 disks doesn't require any moves
move(0, _, _, _) :- !.

% Recursive case: Move N disks from Source to Target using Auxiliary as the auxiliary peg
move(N, Source, Target, Auxiliary) :-
    N > 0,
    M is N - 1,
    move(M, Source, Auxiliary, Target),   % Move top M disks from Source to Auxiliary
    write('Move disk '), write(N),
    write(' from '), write(Source),
    write(' to '), write(Target), nl,
    move(M, Auxiliary, Target, Source).   % Move M disks from Auxiliary to Target

% Example usage:
% To solve Towers of Hanoi with 3 disks:
% ?- hanoi(3).
